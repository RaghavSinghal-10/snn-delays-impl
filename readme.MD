# Implemented Learnable Delays in snnTorch

Implemented the paper:
Learning Delays in Spiking Neural Networks using Dilated Convolutions with Learnable Spacings (https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17670v2) in snnTorch.

The original implementation: https://github.com/Thvnvtos/SNN-delays was referred to and used in this implementation.
